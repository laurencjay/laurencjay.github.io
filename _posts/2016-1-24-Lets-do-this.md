title: Let's Do This
---

Excited to check this off my 2016 resolutions. I want this blog to be a place to bring together my thoughts and experiences as a developer and woman in the tech community. Here I will share new things I'm learning about, tips or tricks I've discovered, articles or vizualizations I find interesting, and a smattering of random thoughts.

Lately, I've been digging into React.js. Next time around, I'll share some tips I've learned along the way. Let's do this, folks!
